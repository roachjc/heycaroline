        Hello, I'm Caroline! I ventured into the realm of social media in 2010.
        I have managed the social media for NBC Universal's comedies such as
        Parks and Rec and The Office, crafted strategic reports for
        entertainment companies like FOX Studios and ABC, and led paid social
        strategies for US Navy, Caesars Entertainment, Domino’s, and Jack in the
        Box, handling budgets over $10M annually.

        Within three months, I drove a 344% increase in Navy recruits and
        transformed $106K of ad spend into $1.5M in revenue for Caesars
        Entertainment. I loved the thrill of helping brands achieve success.

        In 2021, my husband Jon and I said goodbye to San Francisco and moved to
        Winthrop. We have two kids, Hugh (est. Aug 2020) and Eleanor (est. Oct
        2022) both of whom enjoy waving to wild horses, riding bikes, “playing”
        hockey, and learning to ski.

        As a kid, I fantasized about starting a band with my two sisters,
        envisioning a life where we'd tour the globe, spreading joy to crowds
        with beaming faces. However, reality hit, and I discovered that my vocal
        talents leaned more towards creative writing than belting out tunes.
        While my secondary dreams of becoming a princess didn't quite pan out
        either, my boundless imagination and knack for entrepreneurship have led
        me to where I am today.

        My roots in entrepreneurship started early as I watched my parents start
        a coffee roasting company when I was 5, taking naps on the burlap bean
        bags during the early stages. When I turned 16, I started my own t-shirt
        business and sold them out of the trunk of my parent’s station wagon
        outside my high school at lunch time. I realized that if I believed in
        the product, I wasn’t just selling something, I was getting people to
        join in something wonderful.

        So, whether you're chasing dreams like I did on that imaginary stage or
        aiming to turn ad spend into results that matter, we can embark on this
        digital marketing adventure together.
